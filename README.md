## First things first

- *Pro tip*: Clone this repo to your computer first will make your life much easier:
    - If you have already cloned before, update it using `git pull --depth=1`
    - To clone, run: `git clone --depth=1 --single-branch --branch cpp https://github.com/jerryc05/MyTemplate`

1. Copy *everything* from `CMakeLists.txt` file between the line:

   `#===== BEGIN OF CMAKE ARGS TEMPLATE =====`

   and the line:

   `#===== BEGIN OF TARGET CREATION =====`

   to your `CMakelists.txt` accordingly (inclusively).

    - Make sure all target creation commands (e.g. `add_executable()`) are below the line:

   `#===== BEGIN OF TARGET CREATION =====`

2. Copy *everything* in this `cmake-args` folder (including the folder itself) to your project root accordingly.

3. *Optional:* You might also want to copy (and use) `.gitignore`, `main.cpp` and `Misc.h`.

- *CLion*:
    - `File` (or `CLion` in MacOS)
        - `Settings` (or `Preferences` in MacOS)
        - `Build, Execution, Deployment`
        - `CMake`
        - `Profiles` (right panel)

        - Append `-GNinja` to `CMake options` of every profile (notice spaces between args)
    - `File`
      - `New Project Settings`
      - `Settings(Preferences) for New Projects...` - *(Repeat same actions above)*

### [LLVM Clang](https://llvm.org/)

*Pro tip:* LLVM Clang is different from Apple Clang (comes with XCode in MacOS) in many ways
- e.g. Apple Clang has no sanitizers.

#### Download & Install

- Linux(`apt`): `apt install clang`
- MacOS(`brew`): `brew install llvm`
- [Zipped binary](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)

#### How to setup **Clang** in *CLion*

- *CLion*:
    - Follow [this link](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/clion/how-to-create-toolchain-in-clion.html)
    - *Pro tip*: You might want to set **C/C++ Compiler** to `clang/clang++` respectively to use Clang.
    - *Pro tip*: Make sure you are using Clang **from LLVM**, not Apple.
    - *Pro tip*: If you followed [First things first](#first-things-first), CMake will print `USING COMPILER [<compiler_name>]` to stdout.
        - Check that out. Shall be very useful.

### [Clang-Tidy](https://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/)

#### Download & Install

*Pro tip*: Clang-tidy usually comes with Clang altogether and no additional installation is required.

- How do I know if Clang-Tidy can be used in *CLion*?
    - Follow [First things first](#first-things-first) to setup your CMake environment.
    - Follow [How to setup Clang in CLion](#how-to-setup-clang-in-clion) to setup your **LLVM** Clang compiler.
    - Enable static analyzer by uncommenting this line (remove the preceding `#`) in `CMakeLists.txt`:
        ```text
        #set(__USE_ANALYZER__                    ON)
        ```
    - If *CLion* prompt for reloading CMake changes, click `Reload changes` (or `Enable Auto-Reload`).
    - CMake will print these lines to stdout:
        - If succeeful:
            ```
            -- USING COMPILER [LLVM Clang]
            --
            -- 	[STATIC ANALYZER]
            -- 	[STATIC ANALYZER] - ON
            ```
        - If not:
            ```
            -- USING COMPILER [LLVM Clang]
            --
            -- 	[STATIC ANALYZER]
            CMake Error at cmake-args/static-analyzer.cmake:* (message):
                [STATIC ANALYZER] clang-tidy NOT FOUND!
            ```
            - You might want to resolve this issue if you want to use this powerful tool.
    - *\[OPTIONAL\]* Re-comment out the line that you just modified at your wish, since Clang-Tidy might slow down your build time.
        - However, it will produce helpful insights when it is enabled.

In case you really need to install it manually:

- Linux(`apt`): `apt install clang-tidy`

#### How to enable **Clang-Tidy**

- *No action needed if you followed [First things first](#first-things-first).*


## High-level *"switches"*

- *Pro tip*: How to turn on any of the following *"switches"*?
    - Open `CMakeLists.txt`
    - Uncomment that line (remove the preceding `#`) like you did before!
- *Pro tip*: You can safely ignore those explanations about pros and cons.

### Non-sanitizer flags

- `__USE_ANALYZER__`: Use compiler-builtin static analyzer.
    - `Default: OFF`.
    - Pros:
        - Catch known mistakes at compile time.
        - Warns about bad practices/styles. \[Clang-Tidy only\]
    - Cons:
        - Might **SIGNIFICANTLY** slow down compilation time,
        - Might not work for *too complicated* projects.

- `__USE_LATEST_CPP_STD__`: Compile with the latest `C++` std available.
    - `Default: ON`.
    - Pros: Compile with the latest std automatically.
    - Cons: *Refer to incompatibilities between `C++` standards online.*

- `__REL_USE_HACKED_MATH__`: Compile with aggressive/hacky/dirty math optimizations in **RELEASE** mode.
    - `Default: ON`.
    - Pros: Might speed up arithmetic calculation.
    - Cons: Might break IEEE 754 floating-point implementation standard.

### Sanitizer flags

*Pro tip*: Sanitizers will be effective in **DEBUG** mode only.

#### The "Big-Three" sanitizers

*Pro tip*: If you turned any of the "Big-THree" on, **DO NOT** (**DO NOT**! **DO NOT**!) run the program with `Valgrind`.

##### Address sanitizer (`ASAN`)

- `__DBG_SANITIZE_ADDR__`: Compile with **Address Sanitizer**.
    - `Default: ON`.
    - How to enable extra checks of `ASAN` in *CLion*?
        - Make sure you enabled `ASAN` in `CMakeLists.txt`
        - CMake will print some lines to stdout similar to:
            ```
            -- 	[ADDRESS SANITIZER] - ON [WARNING: DO NOT USE WITH VALGRIND!]
            -- 	[ADDRESS SANITIZER] - ASAN_OPTIONS=:allow_addr2line=1:...(blablabla...)
            -- 	                Copy from here! ---^
            ```
        - See the "`^`" in last line?
            - Copy all `options` from where it points to (everything after "`=`") until the end of line.
                - *Be smart! You know what to copy! Don't make silly mistakes!*
        - *CLion*:
            - `File` (or `CLion` in MacOS)
                - `Settings` (or `Preferences` in MacOS)
                - `Build, Execution, Deployment`
                - `Dynamic Analysis Tools`
                - `Sanitizers`
                - On the right panel
                - Paste what you've just copied to `ASAN_OPTIONS` (the one to the right of `AddressSanitizer`)
                - Click `Apply`
    - Pros:
        - Catch memory errors in runtime without sacrificing much performance.
        - Works with IDE debuggers.
    - Cons:
        - Not compatible with `Valgrind`.
        - Not compatible with either `Memory` or `Thread` sanitizer.


<details><summary>Memory sanitizer is deliberately collapsed (you can safely ignore this)</summary><p>

    - **DO NOT USE THIS** unless you know what you are doing.
    -  See below: [why I quitted `MSAN`](#why-i-quitted-msan).
    - `Default: OFF | Support: DROPPED`.
        - Pros:
            - Catch uninitialized memory reads in runtime without sacrificing much performance.

## Misc

### Why I quitted `MSAN`

**TL; DR**:
- `MSAN` will produce false positives unless all parts of code are compiled with `MSAN`.
- However, 99.9% of chance are that you are using compiler-builtin `C++ standard library`, which is not compiled with `MSAN`.

For more info, check these:
- [Handling external code](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html#id10).
- [Using instrumented libraries](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/MemorySanitizer#using-instrumented-libraries).


### Sanitizers vs `Valgrind`

Reference: [Memory/Address Sanitizer vs Valgrind](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47251533/memory-address-sanitizer-vs-valgrind)

#### Sanitizers

- Much faster.
- Much smaller memory overhead.
- Can detect more errors (e.g. non-heap overflows in `ASAN`), but cannot run all sanitizers at the same time.
- Works with IDE debuggers.

#### `Valgrind`

- Detects most of what `ASAN` & `MSAN` & `TSAN` can do at the same time.
- Runs the programi inside a VM (super slow but super accurate).
- *Currently* might still need `Valgrind` to do what `MSAN` can do, since `MSAN` is unsupported.


### Common FAQ

#### 1. Misuse with `Valgrind`

Q: When I run the compiled program with `Valgrind`, I am stuck at something like:
```
Warning: set address range perms: ...
```

A: Kill `Valgrind` (or `memcheck`) immediately , or it will (*likely*) use up **all** system resources and run **forever**.
- A useful command for `*ix` systems is: `ps | grep -F valgrind | grep -v grep | awk '{print "kill -9 " $1}'`. You need to pipe its output to `sh`.
- \[*WARNING AGAIN* !!!\] Any sanitizer that hacks program's memory is incompatible with `Valgrind`.
    - e.g. `ASAN`, `MSAN`, `LSAN`, (*haven't tested`TSAN`*).
    - `UBSAN` is fine.

#### 2. Leak check option in `ASAN`

Q: `ASAN`/`LSAN` does not catch memory leak on MacOS.

A: You have 2 options:
- \[RECOMMENDED\] Follow `ASAN` runtime flags settings above.
- \[NOT RECOMMENDED\] Disable `ASAN` and run with LSAN instead (other `ASAN` checks will also be disabled).
